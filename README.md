# Leetcode Solutions

## Overview

This repository contains solutions to various Leetcode problems implemented in C++. Each problem is solved using different methods and approaches to provide a comprehensive understanding of the problem-solving techniques.

## Structure

Each problem is organized in its own folder, named after the problem number and title. Inside each folder, you will find:

- `README.md`: A file that describes the problem, the solution approach, and relevant tags.
- `one.cpp`, `two.cpp`, etc.: C++ files containing different solution methods for the problem.

### Example Folder Structure

Leetcode/
├── 1143 Largest Common Substring/
│ ├── README.md
│ ├── one.cpp
│ └── two.cpp
├── 0001 Two Sum/
│ ├── README.md
│ ├── one.cpp
│ └── two.cpp
README.md

## README Files

The `README.md` file inside each problem folder follows a consistent structure:

- **Problem**: A brief description of the problem statement.
- **Solution**: A detailed explanation of the solution approaches used in the corresponding C++ files.
- **Tags**: Relevant tags that categorize the problem and solution techniques.

### Example README Structure

```markdown
# Problem Title

## Problem

Description of the problem.

## Solution

1. One - Description of the first solution approach.
2. Two - Description of the second solution approach.

## Tags

- Tag1
- Tag2
- Tag3
```

## Searching by Tags in VSCode

To search for problems based on tags in Visual Studio Code:

1. Open the command palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+P (Mac).
2. Type `Search: Find in Files` and press Enter.
3. In the search bar, type the tag you want to search for (e.g., Dynamic Programming).
4. VSCode will display all the files containing the specified tag, allowing you to quickly locate relevant problems and solutions.

This structure and tagging system will help you efficiently navigate and utilize the repository for studying and solving Leetcode problems.
