# Largest Common Substring

## Problem

Given two strings, find the longest common substring.

## Solution

1. One - Uses a recursive function with memoization to find the length of the longest common substring. The length of the common substring is passed as a reference.
   - Return Type: `void`
   - Top-Down Recursive Approach
   - Memoization
2. Two - Uses a top-down recursive approach with memoization to find the length of the longest common substring. It is returning the length of the longest common substring.
   - Return Type: `int`
   - Top-Down Recursive Approach
   - Memoization
3. Three - Uses a simple recursive approach without memoization to find the length of the longest common substring.
   - Return Type: `int`
   - Simple Recursive Approach
   - No Memoization
